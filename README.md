This allows you to change how room stats are calculated for space, wealth, beauty, impressiveness and cleanliness. You can configure all settings yourself live ingame.
	
Has literally zero dot zero performance impact during gameplay, can be safely added &amp; removed from a game and is translation-ready.

Every single mod I found on the Workshop only provides some of this and all are hard-coded, meaning you have no control over the actual settings or balance. Now, you can do everything!
